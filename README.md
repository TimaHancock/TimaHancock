## About me

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity analyst stuck in the body of an IT Support person with a passion for tech and a knack for solving IT puzzles. With certifications like the CompTIA Trifecta (A+, Net+, Sec+), I spend my days troubleshooting, doing tickets, and helping folks navigate the digital wilds. When I’m not doing password and MFA resets, you might catch me mixing audio for worship services at Chapel RVA (because who doesn’t love tweaking EQ settings?) or diving into TryHackMe challenges for the upskilling. Check out my repositories for some techy goodness, and feel free to ping me if you want to collab or point out my terrible code.

## Objective

The objective is simple. I do stuff, you need to see it, simple as. It ain't much, but it's honest work. While I navigate my career path, I'll try and throw down what I'm building up here. If it looks dumb, please be patient, I can make it much worse soon. Very open to criticism if you are willing, I love to be humbled.
